# PWA | Webpack
PWA stands for **Progressive Web Application.** The main concept of PWA i, it provides all the features of Native App. It provides a feature of **Offline** user interface. 

For example, as we know when we are on `localhost` with `webpack-dev-server` and tries to close the reload and again do reload, we can see the application. So here, PWA comes in picture. PWA gives a feature when we are in offline mode, and tries to refresh the page, than also we will be able to see the application working. It uses the concept of `Service Worker`. 

It also provides a feature like `Add to Home Screen`. For example: I am using **Amazon** without installed in my device, than if my network is not proper, It will suggest me for `Add to Home Screen`. At that time, it will create app automatically in your Home Screen.
