## Webpack Installation :
To install latest or other `version`s of webpack, run the below code
```javascript
npm i --save-dev webpack
// or for other versions
npm i --save-dev webpack@<version>
```

I prefer to install webpack in `development` mode instead of installing it in `production` mode. And If you wanna call `webpack` through command lines then you also need to install `webpack-cli`.
